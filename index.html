      <strong> Thesis title: </strong> Energy Usage and Tire Usage in
      Electric Vehicles with In-Wheel Motors. <br> <br>

      <strong> Abstract: </strong> &nbsp; Electric vehicles (EVs) with
  in-wheel motors (IWMs) are a rapidly emerging technology. These EVs
  lie in a wide power interval, are of different types belonging to
  the categories of bikes, microcars, mid-size cars, full-size cars,
  and buses, and use one or multiple IWMs. Additionally, IWMs enable a
  wide range of vehicle configurations, free up space inside the EV,
  obviate the need for mechanical transmission and axles, and enable
  the EV to have modular designs. A modular design is often a wheel
  assembly primarily consisting of an IWM, a steering motor,
  suspension, and brake.  Among the many recent advancements in EV
  technologies, the modular designs make overactuated EVs possible and
  attractive. For example, a set of four modular designs can help
  build a four-wheel independent steering four-wheel independent drive
  (4WIS4WID) EV; this EV has received attention from the industry and
  academia, especially in the last two decades. As the EVs with IWMs
  1) lie in a wide power interval, 2) are of different types, 3) use
  one or multiple IWMs, and 4) can help build overactuated EVs that
  have the potential to achieve a condition known as optimal tire
  usage (OTU), there is a need to investigate 1) these EVs from energy
  usage perspective and 2) overacutated EVs from tire usage
  perspective. This thesis explores EVs with IWMs from these two
  perspectives.
<br>
 &nbsp; Towards the energy usage perspective, this thesis considers
  battery-powered EVs (BEVs), lying in the power interval of [0.25 --
  360] kW and groups them into five classes. The energy usage of a BEV
  is a determinant of its operational cost and environmental impact. A
  graph of energy efficiency versus power is important while investing
  in new BEV technologies. In constructing this graph over the said
  power interval for single motor drive (SMD) BEVs, the existing
  literature on energy efficiency provides some data for two of the
  five classes, while for IWM BEVs, the literature provides some data
  for just one value of power. To construct these graphs for both SMD
  and IWM BEVs, this thesis performs a comprehensive study of each
  class of BEV to gather realistic data for each stage involved in the
  calculation of their energy efficiencies. It concludes that the
  tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of an IWM BEV may be up to 18\%
  higher than that of an SMD BEV of the same power. In examining how
  efficient the BEVs are with respect to internal combustion engine
  (ICE) vehicles, this thesis concludes that the well-to-wheels energy
  efficiencies of IWM BEVs, SMD BEVs, and ICE vehicles, each of around
  80 kW, are about 33\%, 30\%, and 18\%, respectively for natural gas
  pathway.
<br>
 &nbsp; Towards the tire usage perspective, this thesis primarily considers
  4WIS4WID EVs, which are widely studied and are popular among
  overactuated EVs. These EVs have an independent steering motor and
  an independent driving motor for each wheel, for a total of eight
  motors. About fifteen works in this emerging field have shown
  partial or full path-tracking control (PTC) algorithms for these
  EVs. Of the fifteen works, ten explicitly or implicitly aspire for
  the condition known as OTU; the PTC algorithms are additionally
  responsible for this condition. This condition helps achieve 1) a
  superior vehicle stability margin that improves the vehicle's
  stability, controllability, responsiveness, and cornering behavior,
  and 2) some improvement in energy efficiency, in comparison to
  conventional EVs. Seven of the ten works have shown full PTC
  algorithms for these EVs. This thesis performs in-depth
  block-diagrammatic examinations (BDEs) of five works among the seven
  to understand a PTC algorithm deeply, and to identify modifications,
  if any, needed for OTU.

      <br>
  &nbsp;The thesis finds that while these five works have performed suitable
  control allocation for OTU, examining whether their motor control
  systems (MCSs) are appropriate for fulfilling the control allocation
  demands, is required. In particular, the BDEs reveal that a) two of
  the five works have not paid attention to MCSs, b) the third work
  needs modification in the driving MCSs, and c) the fourth and fifth
  work seems to have appropriate MCSs for OTU. The MCSs of the fifth
  work use a disturbance observer-based control (DOBC) scheme, and
  seem like a good candidate for MCSs in the first three works. Thus
  this thesis a) considers the MCSs of the fifth work, b) makes
  appropriate modifications to them, c) performs the effectiveness
  analyses of the MCSs and their modified versions, and d) therefrom
  recommends necessary MCSs for the first three works. Further, this
  thesis also examines the effectiveness of a widely used and popular
  scheme, known as active disturbance rejection control (ADRC), as an
  alternative to the DOBC scheme for the third and fifth works. The
  PTC algorithm of the fifth work employs these two schemes to
  demonstrate the achievement of OTU in simulation. It shows that
  these schemes are sufficient (in simulation) for OTU in the fifth
  work, and are likely to be sufficient for all PTC algorithms that
      perform the control allocation required for OTU.
