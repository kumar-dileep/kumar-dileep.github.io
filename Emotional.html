            <li><strong>Depression & Anxiety</strong> are the most prevalent mental

 </li> <br>

	   <li> <strong>According to WHO</strong>, around 5% of the world's adult

Depression & Anxiety. Among adults 4% are men and 6% are women.

	   <li> Many people with depression don’t get help for their
symptoms, so the actual number of people living with depression may be
higher. </li> <br>

	   <li> An <strong>estimated 60%</strong> of people who have depression don’t

	     depression.  </li> <br>

	   
<li> <strong>Over 75% of people</strong> living in low-income or

<li> We have seen that depression, anxiety, relationship conflict,
other emotions such as Anger, Frustration, Guilt, Feeling-trapped,
Embarrassment, Inferiority & Shyness are significant cause of
our <strong> emotional pain and suffering</strong>, and that
contribute to feeling us down. </li> <br>

<li> <strong> Buddha once said: </strong>  The cause of all the pain and suffering is
ignorance. That means right understanding/knowledge can alleviate us
from these pain and suffering. My experience and belief also agrees
that the right understanding/knowledge along with right tool can
reduce these pain and suffering to a higher extent. </li> <br>

 <li> <strong> Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong> is a highly
 effective, biologically proven, root cause-based, non-medicative, and

<li> <strong> About Dr. David D. Burns: </strong> He is an American psychiatrist

treatment of Depression, Anxiety and Relation Conflicts. </li> <br>

      <li><strong> 1st Principle: </strong> <i> Cognition, Thought,
 Way of Thinking, Believe, Perception, or Interpretation are the major
 cause of our bad/good emotions, feelings or moods. </i>  <br> &nbsp;
 However, sometimes our feeling/moods/emotions creates certain kinds
 thoughts. For example, when you are physically ill, you may get a
 different kinds of emotions, and that generates a very different
 kinds of thoughts you generally experience when you are not feeling
 well. In contrast, circumstance of our life are not the main cause of
 our good/bad feelings, on which we generally belief.

upset, your thoughts are dominated by pervasive
negativity/ <a href="#Negative">negative thoughts</a>.
	   </li> <br>
 <li><strong> 3rd Principle: </strong> <i> The negative thoughts that
 upset you are nearly always distorted and twisted. </i> (There exits

      <li><strong> Epictetus said in about 2000 years ago: </strong>
People are disturbed “not by things, but by the views we take of
	them.” </li> <br>

        <li><strong>Shakespeare: </strong> “For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” </li> <br>

	  <li><strong> Lori Deschene on Buddha’s statement: </strong>
Thoughts fuel emotions. If you don’t like what you’re feeling, step
back and examine what you’re thinking.” </li>

 &nbsp;      Let us see the general approaches we take to recover from
depression and anxiety and why we should use CBT.  When we feel
symptoms of depression and anxiety, we generally try solutions such as
physical exercise, yoga, meditation, reading motivational books, and
watching motivational videos. These solutions work well and help
recover from depression and anxiety to some extent. However, since
they do not directly address the root problem, which is the thought
process, there is always a higher chance of a relapse. If the problem
does not resolve using these solutions, we either become more hopeless
and start accepting life as it is, or, if the problem is severe, we go
for medication and counseling, which we should definitely
consider. These solutions can also be expensive. However, if you are
looking for a simple, effective, self-help, non-medicative, and
inexpensive option, this note is for you. I will walk you through CBT
and how we can use it. Before going deeper into CBT, let us compare it
medication.

 &nbsp;    In the case of medication, we take medicines that lead to
     chemical changes in our body and brain, which help us feel better
     and emotionally healthy. On the other hand, CBT directly helps
     tune our thought processes, which is the root cause of the
     problems. This ultimately tunes our emotions, feelings, and
     moods, leading to changes in the chemicals in our brain and
     body. Medication has side effects that affect both our body and
     brain, and you also have to invest money in them. On the other
     hand, CBT has no side effects, can be practiced alone, and is
     inexpensive. Medication does not act on the actual cause of the
     problem, which is tuning the thought process. However, CBT acts
     on the root cause of the problem, and it tunes the thought
     process, reducing the chances of a relapse. <br> 
     
&nbsp; The book "Feeling Good" provides a table comparing the
effectiveness of medication and CBT. In this table, 25 patients were
selected for medication and 19 for CBT. Out of 25 patients selected
for medication, 5 recovered completely, 7 had considerable
improvement, 5 had no substantial improvement, and 8 dropped out. On
the other hand, out of 19 patients selected for CBT, 15 recovered
completely, 2 had considerable improvement, 1 had substantial
improvement, and 1 dropped out. Overall, we can see about a 20-50%
recovery rate with medication and an 80-90% recovery rate with CBT. In
summary, CBT is more effective than medication for recovery from
depression and anxiety.

&nbsp; Now let us define our feelings and Moods. Sometimes we hear a lot
about them, particularly depression and anxiety, but we do not know
the actual meaning of them. Steve Jobs said, "If you define the
problem correctly, you almost have the solution." With this quote, let
us first define and understand the actual problems (our feeling and
moods) before moving towards finding their solutions. <br><br>

&nbsp; Feelings and moods are mental states associated with our
behavioral and social responses. Emotions are very similar to Feelings
and moods, However, from a biological perspective, they are defined
as <a href="#Defining"> energy in motion and energy in
motivation</a>. <br> <br>

&nbsp; We can remember all the negative feeling/moods using the word
"<u>PH(F)ANTASIZED</u>." The names of these feeling/moods start with the
letters involved in this word. For example.  Phantasized (PH) is a
mental image of something that is not perceived as real. Fantasized
(F) a daydream, an imagined unreality. Coincidently the Word
Phanatizsed is a mental state that we also feel during the some of
feeling moods shown here.  Panic Anxiety and Nervousness can be
clubbed together as they have similar meaning, similarly depression
and hopelessness can be clubbed together they also also hve similar
meaning.  So let us define and understand each feeling/mood
one-by-one.

     So far, we have understood CBT, its principles, its
     effectiveness, and all the negative feelings, emotions, and
     moods. Now we will try to understand how to quantify our emotions
     and feelings and what their healthy values might be. <br> <br>

 &nbsp; The healthy value of an emotion typically lies between 0% and
       100%. Extreme emotions, such as 0% or 100%, are rare, and such
       quantifications are also good for you and your emotional
       health. Let us understand it using the following example:

 <br> <br>

 &nbsp; Suppose you prepared well for an examination and performed
well, but you failed. There might have been some mistakes in the
evaluation process. You might feel 50% sadness because you failed
despite your best effort and 30% anger because you suspect unfairness
in the evaluation process. These are estimates of your healthy
emotions.
<br>
 &nbsp; However, if you exhibit extreme sadness or anger (100%), you may
become stuck in your emotions and unable to take further action for
re-evaluation, or you might take extreme actions, which could also be
unfair.

<br><br>
 &nbsp; On the other hand, if you do not show any sadness or anger
(0%), it could indicate that you don’t care about yourself, your time,
energy, and effort put into the examination, or you might not be
conscious of fairness in the evaluation process. In this case, you
won’t be motivated to seek re-evaluation or to work hard again for a
reexamination if you genuinely failed.
<br> <br>
 &nbsp; Both extreme cases are not beneficial and are likely to create
       other emotions such as depression, anxiety, hopelessness,
       loneliness, inadequacy, and guilt. In short, any deviation from
       the healthy value is the main cause of our emotional pain and
       suffering due to undesired emotions. That is why it is very
       important to estimate the healthy value of your emotions.

      In a biological perspective, emotions can be defined as energy
     in motion or energy in motivation. Now let us understand where
     emotions come from using an example shown in the following figure
     having five steps.

   Emotions/Feelings and Their Healthy Values. Information taken from

       <ul>
	 <li> <strong>Step 1:</strong> The brain receives information
from inside the body and from the outside world. For example, you
suddenly hear loud and unexpected sound and saw a cat suddenly jumping
in a fear. </li><br>

 <li> <strong>Step 2:</strong> The brain interprets this information to make sense of
what’s happening and to predict what’s going to happen next or what
you need to do. Making predictions is one of the most important brain
functions. Interpreting information and making predictions occurs
quickly and takes place almost entirely at an unconscious level we
don’t even notice. For example, your brain may be interpreting the
unexpected sound and predicting that the sound is of a tiger, that is
why the cat was jumping in fear. </li> <br>

<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> The brain next creates emotions as motivations that push
you to respond so that what you do is aligned with your
interpretations and predictions. This happens quickly and without your
conscious awareness. Emotions are not conclusions you reach; instead,
they are rapid and unconscious reactions to your interpretations and
predictions. Whatever emotions you’re experiencing, the key to
understanding them is to identify the interpretations that cause
them. For example, after predicting that there is a sound of tiger,
your brain creates emotions as a motivation to either fight or flight
quickly without conscious effort. </li> <br>

 <li> <strong>Step 4:</strong> It’s possible that the first interpretations and predictions
 you make are wrong, so your brain also performs some quality
 control. In this step, your brain re-analyzes information in case the
 interpretations and predictions are needed to be changed. If one
 interpretation is more correct than another one, your brain usually
 selects the one that’s more accurate. After all, you’re more likely
 to survive if your predictions are based on correct interpretations
 rather than incorrect ones. For example, after performing the quality
 control by brain, you may find that the sound is generated
 artificially by a music system. </li> <br>

<li> <strong>Step 5:</strong> If the original interpretations and predictions are
wrong, then your brain also may have generated the wrong emotions. By
performing the quality control, your brain automatically generates
different emotions to match your new interpretations and
predictions. For example, after predicting that there is no tiger, our
brain automatically and unconsciously generates different kinds of
emotions, and you see that the situation in a completely different
perspective. </li>

       So far we have understood CBT and its three principle, defined
       negative feelings and emotions, understood their healthy
       values, touched how our brain works and processes information,
       and how it generates emotions. Now let us define negative
       thoughts and thoughts distortions; they are important for
       understanding CBT. </br>

&nbsp; We heard a lot negative thoughts from friends and families that
is, "don’t think negative" and "don’t make negative thoughts". But
       sometimes we don’t know what do you mean by a negative thought. 

  </br><br>

&nbsp; A negative thought has a necessary and a sufficient condition:
        <ul>
	 <li> The <strong> necessary condition </strong> is a thought
	   that upsets you and makes you feel down, and </li> <br>

	   <li> the <strong>sufficient condition</strong> is that you must have a
	     strong belief in the thought. </li>
	</ul>

&nbsp; The properties of the negative thoughts are:
        <ul>
	 <li> Intensity of feelings/emotions related to the thought is
far from their healthy values. </li> <br>

	   <li> Your strong belief in it is the main cause behind your
  emotional pain and suffering. </li>
	</ul>

	    condition of a negative thought, and examples of negative
	    thoughts.  </h5> </figcaption>
    </figure>
       </center>

 
&nbsp; A negative thought is a clear statement without any feelings or
       emotions.  For Example:
       <ul>
	 <li>I am not good enough.</li>
	 <li> I am unlovable.</li>
         <li> I am boring. </li>
	 <li>I am a failure.</li>
	 <li> I am worthless. </li>
	 <li> This thing always happens with me. </li>
	 </ul>

 &nbsp; Note that a negative thought should not start with “I feel”
 statement, for example, I feel bad. This statement is a feeling, not
 a example of negative thought.<br> <br>

 &nbsp; We have seen in third Principle of CBT, that a negative
 thought that upsets you are nearly always distorted and twisted. Now
 let us define "distorted thoughts" or "thought distortions".

       Let us understand the thought distortion using an example

       between husband and wife, which completes in four steps.

	 <li> <strong> In Step 1:</strong> Husband complains to his
wife that she is too messy, and always be late when something
important to do. </li> <br>

	   <li> <strong> In Step 2:</strong> She reacts by arguing
back and saying, "That’s not true!".  Then the fight spirals out of
control. </li> <br>

	 <li> <strong>In Step 3:</strong> She Fears that her
	   relationship is in verge of brake due to the
	   conflict.</li> <br>

	  <li> <strong>In Step 4:</strong> She reaches at a conclusion
in her mind that "I am unlovable", that is why he is
complaining. </li> <br>

<li> But the <strong>fact is</strong> that she is an very attractive,
loving, and smart woman. </li> <br>

<li> Her <strong> conclusive or resultant thought</strong>, 'I am unlovable,' is the
automatic and negative thought, in which she has a strong belief. This
belief cause her mental turmoil. However, this thought seems
  completely unrealistic. </li> <br>

  <li> The <strong> actual problem</strong> stems from her husband's complaint, which she
is defending. </li> <br>

<li> So let us see <strong> 12 thought distortions </strong> that we
generally find in negative thoughts, and examine how many of them
belong in her negative thought.

       The following figure capture is the 12 thoughts distortions,
       which are typcailly found negative thoughts. I have associated
       them with <strong>12 body parts</strong>, so that it will be easy for you to
       remember or memorize.

    </figure>
       </center>
       
       <ul style="list-style: none;">
	 <li> <strong> 1. All-or-Nothing Thinking:</strong> I have
associated it with our <strong> HAIR </strong>, which can be black, white, or a
combination of both.<br>  &nbsp; In this distortion, you think about
yourself or the world in black-or-white, all-or-nothing
categories. Shades of gray do not exist. When you fail, you tell
yourself that you’re a complete failure. </li> <br>

	 	  <ul>
	 <li> For the example discussed <a href="#Distortions">
here</a>: She sees herself as either "lovable" or "unlovable," with no
in-between.
	 </li>
         </ul>
	 <br>


	 
	 <li> <strong> 2. Mind Reading:</strong> I have associated it
with our <strong> FOREHEAD </strong>, which can be the outer layer of
our brain that involves in reading minds.
<br> &nbsp; In this distortion, you assume that you know what other
people are thinking and feeling without any evidence. If you are shy,
you may tell yourself that people will judge you if they find out how
insecure you feel.  </li> <br>

	 	  <ul>
	 <li> For the example discussed  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>: She might be reading her husband’s mind that he would be finding her unlovable. However, there does not exist any evidence behind the mind reading.
	 </li>
         </ul>
	 <br>


	 <li> <strong> 3.  Discounting the Positives:</strong> I have
	 associated it with our <strong> EAR </strong>, which
	 sometimes only wants to hear things you are willing to accept
	 and rejects others.
<br> &nbsp; In this case, you tell yourself that certain positive
facts don’t count. When someone compliments you, you tell yourself
that they’re only saying that to make you feel good. </li> <br>

	 	  <ul>
	 <li> For the example discussed  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>: She is
 ignoring her many positive qualities. She is a lovely and talented
 woman.
	 </li>
         </ul>
	 <br>


	 <li> <strong> 4. Mental Filtering: </strong> I have associated it
	 with the <strong> NOSE </strong>, which detects the quality
	 of air and shows willingness to accept good quality of
	 air. This quality is very similar to a brain function where
	 it enables you to focus on something negatives and filter out
	 all the positives.

	  
<br> &nbsp; In this case you become obsessed about some shortcoming
and ignore your positive qualities. This is like a drop of ink that
discolors the entire beaker of water. </li> <br>

	 	  <ul>
	 <li> For the example discussed  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>: She is
	 completely ignoring her many positive qualities that she is a
	 lovely and talented woman.
	 </li>
         </ul>
	 <br>	 


	 
	 <li> <strong> 5. Overgeneralization: </strong> I have
	 associated it with the <strong> MOUTH </strong> , which
	 involves expressing overgeneralized thoughts.

	  
<br>  &nbsp; In  this case,  you think  that a  negative event  always
happens to you or is a  never-ending pattern. If something bad happens
to you  twice or thrice, you  tell yourself that it  always happens to
you. </li> <br>

	 	  <ul>
	 <li> For the example discussed  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>: She
	 might be telling that such conflict always happens with
	 her. However, in reality, similar conflicts are very common
	 in husband and wife.
	 </li>
         </ul>
		  <br>




	 <li> <strong> 6. Should Statement: </strong> I have
	 associated it with <strong> SHOULDER </strong>, which is very
	 similar to Should in terms of accepting taking the
	 responsibility for something. 
	  
<br> &nbsp; In this case you make yourself miserable with should,
musts, or ought to statement.  There are Self-directed,
Other-directed, and World-directed shoulds. <br>

&nbsp; <strong> -Self-directed shoulds </strong> cause feelings of guilt, shame, depression, and
worthlessness.

<br>

&nbsp; <strong> -Other directed shoulds </strong> trigger feelings of anger and
frustration toward others. <br>

&nbsp; <strong> -World-directed shoulds </strong> cause feelings of
anger and frustration toward the world. <br> <br>

&nbsp; There also exists some <strong> hidden shoulds</strong>, for
example, if you are telling yourself I am looser, you might be telling
yourself that I should not be a looser.
 </li> <br>

	 	  <ul>
	 <li> For the example discussed  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>: She
might be telling herself that her husband shouldn’t argue with
her. This is example of other-directed should.  She might be telling
that I should be lovable. This is an example of self-directed should.
She is telling herself that she is unlovable, which is indicating she
should be lovable. This is an example of a hidden should statement.
	 </li>
         </ul>
		  <br>


		  
	 <li> <strong> 7.  Magnification and Minimization: </strong> I
	 have associated it with <strong> LUNGS</strong> that help us
	 breathe by maximizing and minimizing the exchange of gases, a
	 very similar function that our brain plays with our thoughts.

	  
<br> &nbsp; In this case you blow things out of proportion or shrink
their importance inappropriately. This is also called the “binocular
trick” because things look much bigger or much smaller depending on
what end of the binoculars you look through. In the case of
procrastination, you often focus on everything you’ve postponed,
convincing yourself that it will be extremely overwhelming. This is
the case of magnification. On the other hand you may downplay today's
efforts as insignificant, leading you to delay tasks further, which is
an example of minimization. </li> <br>

	 	  <ul>
	 <li> For the example discussed  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>: She is
	 blowing things way out of proportion by telling herself as I
	 am unlovable.
 
	 </li>
         </ul>
		  <br>




		  
	 <li> <strong> 8 & 9. Other Blame and Self blame: </strong> I
have associated them with our <strong> FINGERS</strong> fingers, which
reminds us a famous saying: when you point one finger at others for
their faults, there are always three fingers pointing back at you,
reminding you to see your own faults too before pointing out faults in
others.
	  
	   <br> &nbsp; In the case of <strong> Other blame</strong>,
	   You use all your energy finding fault with others. Such
	   blame is very common in relationship conflict where you
	   tell yourself that the other person is to blame for the
	   problems in our relationship, so you feel like an innocent
	   victim and overlook your own role in the problem.


	 </li> <br>

	 	  <ul>
	 <li> For the example discussed  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>: She
	 might be telling herself that her husband has a mental
	 problem, and therefore, he needs to be blamed for the
	 conflict. She perceives herself as not playing any role in
	 the conflict, it means that she is not contributing anything
	 for the conflict. Consequently, she feels that she doesn’t
	 have to change herself.
 
	 </li>
		  </ul> 

		  
	   <br> &nbsp; In the case of <strong> Self Blame</strong>, You use all your
	   energy finding fault with yourself. You criticize yourself
	   mercilessly for every error and shortcoming you are
	   committing, instead of using your energy to find creative
	   solutions to your problems.

	 </li> <br><br>

	 	  <ul>
	 <li> For the example discussed  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>: She
might be telling herself that the conflict happens because she is
unlovable. In this case, she is placing complete blame on herself for
the conflict.
 
	 </li>
         </ul>
		  <br>


		  
	 <li> <strong> 10.  Emotional Reasoning: </strong> I have associated it with the <strong> HEART</strong>, as it is closely tied to our good or bad feelings & emotions. 
	  
<br> &nbsp; In emotional reasoning, you reason from how you feel. This
can be very misleading because your feelings result entirely from your
thoughts and not from external reality. You tell yourself, “I feel
like a loser, so I must really be one.” Or “I feel hopeless, so I must
be hopeless. </li> <br>

	 	  <ul>
	 <li> For the example discussed  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>: She may
	 be feeling unlovable that is why she is calling herself she
	 is unlovable.
 
	 </li>
         </ul>
		  <br>




		  
	 <li> <strong> 11.  Fortune telling: </strong> I have
	 associated it with <strong> PALM</strong> because palm
	 reading or Palmistry is a pseudoscientific practice of
	 fortune-telling. Such practice is found all over the world,
	 with numerous cultural variations.
	  
<br> &nbsp; In this case, you make negative or positive predictions
about the future. If you’re depressed, you tell yourself that your
problems can never be solved and that you’ll be depressed
forever. </li> <br>

	 	  <ul>
	 <li> For the example discussed  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>: If she
	 is suffering from depression. She might be telling herself
	 that the conflict is never going to die. In the case of
	 anxiety, she may be telling herself that she is the verge of
	 breaking her relationship, and she is predicting that one day
	 it will definitely break.
 
	 </li>
         </ul>
		  <br>
		  

		 
		  
<li> <strong> 12. Labeling: </strong> I have associated it with
our <strong> ABDOMINAL</strong> having a sticker with negative
thoughts/quotes.

<br> &nbsp; In this case you label yourself or others where you see
your yourself or someone else as totally defective or
superior. </li> <br>

	 	  <ul>
	 <li> For the example discussed  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>: She is
	 clearly labeling herself as “I am unlovable”.

	    D. Burns). It involves steps A to M, which should be
	    followed when writing. </h5> </figcaption>
    </figure>
 </center>



<li> <strong> Step A: Upsetting Event:</strong>
<br> Write about an upsetting event or incident from which the
negative or automatic thoughts emerge. Address each event/incident
individually -- do not include multiple events in the same journal
entry. Note that most of your emotional distress is typically tied to
the specific event.<br>
&nbsp;  For the example considered  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>: <strong> Upsetting event is
 "Argument with husband". </strong> </li> <br>

 

<li> <strong> Step B: Date and Time of the event: </strong>
  <br> Write exact <strong> date and time </strong> of the event. </li>
<br>


<li> <strong> Step C & D: Identification of Emotions and their
    Intensity: </strong> <br> Identify the emotions and quantify them
    as per their actual intensities (%Now). <br> <br> For the example
    considered  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>, She would be feeling:</li>


	  <ul>
	    <li> Sad + Unhappy 🡪 80% </li>

	   <li> Anxious + Frightened 🡪 90% </li>

	    <li> Guilt + Bad 🡪 60% </li>

	   <li> Inferior + Defective 🡪 80% </li>

	    <li>Lonely + Rejected + alone 🡪 90% </li>

	    <li> Humiliated + Self-conscious 🡪 80% </li>

	    <li> Hopeless + Despairing 🡪 70% </li>

	    <li> Frustrated + Stuck 🡪 60% </li>

	    <li> Angry + Upset 🡪 75% </li>

	    <li> Feeling trapped 🡪 80% </li>
	  </ul>

	  <li> <strong> Step E & F: Identification of negative
    thoughts and your belief in them: </strong> <br> Identify the
    negative thoughts related to the upsetting event along with your
    believe in the thought (%Now).  <br> <br>

    Do not write feeling and emotions as they are covered in Step C.
 <br> <br> For the example considered  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>, some of her negative
    thoughts and her current believes would be: </li>


	  <ul>
	    <li>  I am unlovable  🡪 90% </li>

	   <li> No one cares about me. 🡪 80% </li>

	    <li> I am worthless. 🡪 90% </li>

	   

	    <li>  I am stuck in a bad relationship 🡪 90%    </li>

	    <li> I should not marry him. 🡪 80% </li>

	    <li> I am a bad wife. 🡪 90% </li>
	  </ul>

  <li> <strong> Step G: Positive Refraiming: </strong> Positive
  reframing is a tool to see the positive sides of the negative
  feelings and thoughts by asking the following two questions. This is
  useful for reducing your resistance that come while writing Daily
  Mood Journal.<br>

    
	  <ul>
	    <li> Q1: What are some benefits, or advantages, of this
	    negative thought or feeling? How might it be helping
	    you? </li> <br>

	     <li> Q2: What does this negative thought or feeling show
	     about you and your core values that’s positive and
	     awesome? </li>
	  </ul>

	  Addressing these two questions for the all the contributing
	  emotions and negative thought helps set the Goal (%) for the
	  emotions (can be called their Healthy values) to be used in
	  Step H. <br> <br>
</li>

&nbsp; Some examples of positive refraiming of the emotions/negative
	  thoughts.

<ul>
	    <li> <strong> Anxiety </strong> 🡪 It motivates her to do
the hard work to save her relationship.  It makes her vigilant about
trying to protect her relationship. She care a lot about her
relationship. </li>

<strong>Why Positive Reframing? </strong>


<li> The moment you see the positive side of your negative thoughts
and feelings, you find that your negative thoughts and feelings are
not, in fact, the result of what’s wrong with you but what’s right
with you. You sometimes feel proud of some of your negative
thoughts. </li> <br>

<li> It melts resistances for your willingness to change. </li><br>

<li> It retains core values and benefits of feelings/emotions. </li><br>

<li> It helps set the realistic goal (<strong>Step H</strong>) that retains your core
values and benefits, at the same time you also feel better and
  emotionally healthy.</li> <br><br>





  <li> <strong> Step H: Set Realistic Goals: </strong> Set the
  realistic goal that retains your core values and benefits, at the
  same time you also feel better and <a href="#Healthy"> emotionally
  healthy</a>.  
  </li>
   <br> <br> For the example considered  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>, She would be estimating
    the following goals for her emotions/feelings:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li> Sad + Unhappy 🡪 <strong> 20% </strong>  </li>

	   <li> Anxious + Frightened 🡪 <strong> 30%  </strong> </li>

	    <li> Guilt + Bad 🡪 <strong> 30%  </strong> </li>

	   <li> Inferior + Defective 🡪 <strong> 20%  </strong> </li>

	    <li>Lonely + Rejected + alone 🡪 <strong> 30%  </strong> </li>

	    <li> Humiliated + Self-conscious 🡪 <strong> 20% </strong>  </li>

	    <li> Hopeless + Despairing 🡪 <strong> 10% </strong>  </li>

	    <li> Frustrated + Stuck 🡪 <strong> 20% </strong>  </li>

	    <li> Angry + Upset 🡪 <strong> 15%  </strong> </li>

	    <li> Feeling trapped 🡪 <strong> 0%  </strong> </li>
	  </ul>


	    <li> <strong> Step I: Set Realistic Goals: </strong>
Identify distortions from <a href="#12Distortions"> 12 thought
distortions </a> for each negative thoughts, and use
their <a href="#shortforms">short forms</a>.
  </li> <br>
For the example considered  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>, some of her negative thoughts and
    her current believes would be: </li>


	  <ul>
	    <li> I am unlovable 🡪 <strong>AN, HS, MF, DP, ER, SB, MR, LB </strong></li>

	   <li> No one cares about me. 🡪 <strong>AN, SS, ER, OV, ER, FT </strong></li>

	    <li> I am worthless. 🡪 <strong>AN, MF, ER, MM, SB </strong></li>

	    <li> I am stuck in a bad relationship 🡪<strong> HS, FT, ER, SB, OB,
	    DP </strong> </li>

	    <li> I should not marry him. 🡪 <strong>SS, FT, ER, MF, DP </strong></li>

	    <li> I am a bad wife. 🡪 <strong>LB, AN, HS, SB, OB, MM, OV </strong></li>
	  </ul>


	  
	    <li> <strong> Step J and K: Positive Thoughts: </strong> We
learned about <a href="#Negative">negative thought</a> that to
	      experience emotional distress: </li>

	   
        <ul>
	 <li> You must have a thought that upsets you and makes you
	   feel down (<strong>necessary condition</strong>),
	   and </li> <br>

	   <li> You must have a strong belief in the thought
	   (<strong>sufficient condition</strong>). </li>
	</ul>
   
</strong> On the other hand, a positive can help you feel better and
emotionally healthy. The positive thought must have the following
conditions:
	   
        <ul>
	 <li> (<strong>necessary condition</strong>), You have a a
thought (or identify a thought) that must crush the respective
negative thought, or drastically reduce your belief in the negative
thought (<strong>necessary condition</strong>)) and </li> <br>

	   <li> You must have a strong belief in the thougth for the
	   chosen negative thought (<strong>sufficient
	   condition</strong>). Fill the value of your strong belief
	   in (<strong>Step K</strong>). </li>
	</ul>


There are 50 techniques that you can be applied to crush the negative
thoughts. <strong> 15 frequently used techniques are
	  discussed <a href="#15techniques">here</a></strong>.
	<br><br> For the example considered  <a href="#Distortions"> here</a>, positive thoughts
 for her negative thoughts would be: </li>


	  <ul>
	    <li> <strong>Negative thought:</strong> I am unlovable
	    🡪 <br><strong>Positive thought:</strong> Sometimes I feel
	    unlovable, especially during arguments, but not always.
	    (<strong>Straightforward techniques</strong>). </li><br>

	   <li><strong>Negative thought:</strong> No one cares about
	   me. 🡪 <br><strong>Positive thought:</strong> It’s not
	   entirely true — many of my friends and relatives care
	   about me a lot. (<strong>Examine the
	   evidence</strong>). </li> <br>

	    <li> <strong>Negative thought:</strong> I am
	    worthless. 🡪 <br><strong>Positive thought:</strong> No,
	    taking this event into account has nothing to do with
	    proving that I am worthless. (<strong>Examine the
	    evidence</strong>). </li><br>

	   

	    <li> <strong>Negative thought:</strong> I am stuck in a
	    bad relationship 🡪 <br> <strong>Positive thought:</strong>
	    To some extent, I feel stuck in a difficult
	    relationship. But in general, all relationships experience
	    some conflict at some point. There's no guarantee that if
	    I were in another relationship, such conflicts wouldn't
	    happen there as well.(<strong>Socratic Method & Thinking
	    in terms of Shades of Gray</strong>) </li><br>

	    <li> <strong>Negative thought:</strong>I should not marry
	    him. 🡪 <br> <strong>Positive thought:</strong> It would be
	    nice if I were married to a different person, but there's
	    still a high chance that similar conflicts would happen
	    with them too.(<strong>Semantic Method & Thinking in terms
	    of Shades of Gray</strong>) </li><br>

	    <li> <strong>Negative thought:</strong>I am a bad
	    wife. 🡪 <br> <strong>Positive thought:</strong> This
	    single incident does not prove that I am a bad
	    wife. Sometimes bad behavior happens, but that doesn't
	    mean a bad person exists. If I try to define what a "bad
	    person" is, I can't. In fact, surveys suggest that I'm not
	    a bad person at all — they actually say I'm a nice
	    person. (<strong>Let's define terms, and Survey
	    technique</strong>) </li>
	  </ul>
	    
	  
	    <li> <strong> Step L and M: Current believe (% after) in
		the negative thougths (Step L) and Emotions (Step
		M): </strong> </li>

	   
        <ul>
	 <li>
	      Evaluate and write your current believe in each negative
		thought in % After column of <strong>Step L</strong>. </li>

	    <li> Estimate and write your current intensities of
emotions in % After column of <strong>Step M</strong>.
	</li></ul> <br>
