            <li>Depression & Anxiety are the most prevalent mental
	      health issue worldwide. </li> <br>

	     <li>  They are the world's oldest cons (Dr. David
D. Burns). </li> <br>
            <li> They contribute significantly to emotional pain and suffering for individual.
             </li> <br>

            also contribute significantly to the emotional pain and
            suffering.
 </li> <br>

	   <li> According to WHO, around 5% of the world's adult
population and 5.7 % people over 60 years are suffering from
Depression & Anxiety. Among adults 4% are men and 6% are women.
 </li> <br>

	   <li> Many people with depression don’t get help for their
symptoms, so the actual number of people living with depression may be
higher. </li> <br>

	   <li> An estimated 60% of people who have depression don’t
	     seek professional support, in part due to the stigma of
	     depression.  </li> <br>

	   
<li> Over 75% of people living in low-income or middle-income countries
  never get treatment for depression due to treatment barriers.  </li> <br>


<li> Rate of depression is increasing [5 – 7 %] in 5 years, particularly in
Adults and Adolescents.

<li> We have seen that depression, anxiety, relationship conflict,
other emotions such as Anger, Frustration, Guilt, Feeling-trapped,
Embarrassment, Inferiority & Shyness are significant cause of
our <strong> emotional pain and suffering</strong>, and that
contribute to feeling us down. </li> <br>

<li> <strong> Buddha once said: </strong>  The cause of all the pain and suffering is
ignorance. That means right understanding/knowledge can alleviate us
from these pain and suffering. My experience and belief also agrees
that the right understanding/knowledge along with right tool can
reduce these pain and suffering to a higher extent. </li> <br>

 <li> <strong> Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong> is a highly
 effective, biologically proven, root cause-based, non-medicative, and
 self-help treatment for them. </li> <br>

<li> Resources are mostly taken from the books named <strong> 'Feeling
Good', 'Feeling Good Together'</strong> and <strong>'Feeling
Great' </strong> authored by Prof. (Dr.)  David D.  Burns.  </li> <br>

<li> <strong> About Dr. David D. Burns: </strong> He is an American psychiatrist
and adjunct professor emeritus in the Department of Psychiatry and
Behavioral Sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine. His
recent book named 'Feeling Great' has gained huge popularity for the
treatment of Depression, Anxiety and Relation Conflicts. </li> <br>

<li> <strong> The goal of this note </strong> is to provide you deeper understanding
about depression, anxiety, and other emotions, and how to use CBT to address
these issues. We will first understand CBT and its principles. </li>

    <ul>
      <li><strong> 1st Principle: </strong> <i> Cognition, Thought,
 Way of Thinking, Believe, Perception, or Interpretation are the major
 cause of our bad/good emotions, feelings or moods. </i>  <br> &nbsp;
 However, sometimes our feeling/moods/emotions creates certain kinds
 thoughts. For example, when you are physically ill, you may get a
 different kinds of emotions, and that generates a very different
 kinds of thoughts you generally experience when you are not feeling
 well. In contrast, circumstance of our life are not the main cause of
 our good/bad feelings, on which we generally belief.
      </li> <br>

           <li><strong> 2nd Principle: </strong> <i> When you are
upset, your thoughts are dominated by pervasive negativity/ negative
thoughts.</i> (I will explain later what do we means by negative
thoughts?)
	   </li> <br>
 <li><strong> 3rd Principle: </strong> <i> The negative thoughts that
 upset you are nearly always distorted and twisted. </i> (There exits
 about 12 thoughts distortion, that I will discribe later in this
 note.)

<li>
<center> <strong> <i> The core of message of CBT </strong> is that <strong> when you change
the way you think, You can change the way you feel.</i> </strong> </center> </li> <br>

<li> Various quotes also support the core message, such as,

 <ul>
      <li><strong> Epictetus said in about 2000 years ago: </strong>
People are disturbed “not by things, but by the views we take of
	them.” </li> <br>

        <li><strong>Shakespeare: </strong> “For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” </li> <br>

	  <li><strong> Lori Deschene on Buddha’s statement: </strong>
Thoughts fuel emotions. If you don’t like what you’re feeling, step
back and examine what you’re thinking.” </li>

       Let us see the general approaches we take to recover from
depression and anxiety and why we should use CBT.  When we feel
symptoms of depression and anxiety, we generally try solutions such as
physical exercise, yoga, meditation, reading motivational books, and
watching motivational videos. These solutions work well and help
recover from depression and anxiety to some extent. However, since
they do not directly address the root problem, which is the thought
process, there is always a higher chance of a relapse. If the problem
does not resolve using these solutions, we either become more hopeless
and start accepting life as it is, or, if the problem is severe, we go
for medication and counseling, which we should definitely
consider. These solutions can also be expensive. However, if you are
looking for a simple, effective, self-help, non-medicative, and
inexpensive option, this note is for you. I will walk you through CBT
and how we can use it. Before going deeper into CBT, let us compare it
medication.

     In the case of medication, we take medicines that lead to
     chemical changes in our body and brain, which help us feel better
     and emotionally healthy. On the other hand, CBT directly helps
     tune our thought processes, which is the root cause of the
     problems. This ultimately tunes our emotions, feelings, and
     moods, leading to changes in the chemicals in our brain and
     body. Medication has side effects that affect both our body and
     brain, and you also have to invest money in them. On the other
     hand, CBT has no side effects, can be practiced alone, and is
     inexpensive. Medication does not act on the actual cause of the
     problem, which is tuning the thought process. However, CBT acts
     on the root cause of the problem, and it tunes the thought
     process, reducing the chances of a relapse. <br> 
     
&nbsp; The book "Feeling Good" provides a table comparing the
effectiveness of medication and CBT. In this table, 25 patients were
selected for medication and 19 for CBT. Out of 25 patients selected
for medication, 5 recovered completely, 7 had considerable
improvement, 5 had no substantial improvement, and 8 dropped out. On
the other hand, out of 19 patients selected for CBT, 15 recovered
completely, 2 had considerable improvement, 1 had substantial
improvement, and 1 dropped out. Overall, we can see about a 20-50%
recovery rate with medication and an 80-90% recovery rate with CBT. In
summary, CBT is more effective than medication for recovery from
depression and anxiety.

Now let us define our feelings and Moods. Sometimes we hear a lot
about them, particularly depression and anxiety, but we do not know
the actual meaning of them. Steve Jobs said, "If you define the
problem correctly, you almost have the solution." With this quote, let
us first define and understand the actual problems (our feeling and
moods) before moving towards finding their solutions. <br><br>

Feelings and moods are mental states associated with our behavioral
and social responses. Emotions are very similar to Feelings and moods,
However, from a biological perspective, they are defined as energy in
motion and energy in motivation, that <strong> I will discuss in in detail
later in this note. </strong> <br> <br>

We can remember all the negative feeling/moods using the word
"<u>PH(F)ANTASIZED</u>." The names of these feeling/moods start with the
letters involved in this word. For example.  Phantasized (PH) is a
mental image of something that is not perceived as real. Fantasized
(F) a daydream, an imagined unreality. Coincidently the Word
Phanatizsed is a mental state that we also feel during the some of
feeling moods shown here.  Panic Anxiety and Nervousness can be
clubbed together as they have similar meaning, similarly depression
and hopelessness can be clubbed together they also also hve similar
meaning.  So let us define and understand each feeling/mood
one-by-one.

      <li> you are a failure or worthless. </li>
      <li>you have lost something important to your sense of self-esteem. </li>
