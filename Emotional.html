            <li>Depression & Anxiety are the most prevalent mental
	      health issue worldwide. </li> <br>

	     <li>  They are the world's oldest cons (Dr. David
D. Burns). </li> <br>
            <li> They contribute significantly to emotional pain and suffering for individual.
             </li> <br>
            <li> Emotions, such as Anger, Frustration, Guilt,
            Feeling-trapped, Embarrassment, Inferiority & Shyness,
            also contribute significantly to the emotional pain and
            suffering.
 </li> <br>

	   <li> According to WHO, around 5% of the world's adult
population and 5.7 % people over 60 years are suffering from
Depression & Anxiety. Among adults 4% are men and 6% are women.
 </li> <br>

	   <li> Many people with depression don’t get help for their
symptoms, so the actual number of people living with depression may be
higher. </li> <br>

	   <li> An estimated 60% of people who have depression don’t
	     seek professional support, in part due to the stigma of
	     depression.  </li> <br>

	   
<li> Over 75% of people living in low-income or middle-income countries
  never get treatment for depression due to treatment barriers.  </li> <br>


<li> Rate of depression is increasing [5 – 7 %] in 5 years, particularly in
Adults and Adolescents.

<li> We have seen that depression, anxiety, relationship conflict,
other emotions such as Anger, Frustration, Guilt, Feeling-trapped,
Embarrassment, Inferiority & Shyness are significant cause of
our <strong> emotional pain and suffering</strong>, and that
contribute to feeling us down.

<li> <strong> Buddha once said: </strong>  The cause of all the pain and suffering is
ignorance. That means right understanding/knowledge can alleviate us
from these pain and suffering. My experience and belief also agrees
that the right understanding/knowledge along with right tool can
reduce these pain and suffering to a higher extent. </li>

 <li> <strong> Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong> is a highly
 effective, biologically proven, root cause-based, non-medicative, and
 self-help treatment for them. </li>




<li> Resources are mostly taken from the books named <strong> 'Feeling
Good', 'Feeling Good Together'</strong> and <strong>'Feeling
Great' </strong> authored by Prof. (Dr.)  David D.  Burns.  </li>

<li> <strong> About Dr. David D. Burns: </strong> He is an American psychiatrist
and adjunct professor emeritus in the Department of Psychiatry and
Behavioral Sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine. His
recent book named 'Feeling Great' has gained huge popularity for the
treatment of Depression, Anxiety and Relation Conflicts. </li>

<li> <strong> The goal of this note </strong> is to provide you deeper understanding
about depression, anxiety, and other emotions, and how to use CBT to address
these issues. We will first understand CBT and its principles. </li>

 <ul>
<li><strong>  Cognition </strong> means Thought, Way of Thinking, Believe, Perception,  or Interpretation.

<li><strong> Three principles of CBT:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong> First Principle: </strong> Cognition, Thought, Way
 of Thinking, Believe, Perception, Interpretation are the major cause
 of our bad/good emotions, feelings or moods. <br> However, sometimes
 our feeling/moods/emotions creates certain kinds thoughts. For
 example, when you are physically ill, you may get a different kinds
 of emotions, and that generates a very different kinds of thoughts
 you generally experience when you are not feeling well. When you go
 to temple, you may get different types of emotions, and thus you have
 completely different thoughs. In Contrast, circumstance of our life
 are not the main cause of our good/bad feelings, on which we
 generally belief.
      </li>

           <li><strong> Second Principle: </strong> When you are
upset, your thoughts are dominated by pervasive negativity/ negative
thoughts. (I will explain later what do we means by negative
thoughts?)
	   </li>
 <li><strong> Third Principle: </strong>The negative thoughts that
 upset you are nearly always distorted and twisted. (There exits about
 12 thoughts distortion, that I will discribe later in this note.)
	   </li>
	   
    </ul> 
	
<li>
<strong> The core of message of CBT </strong> is that <strong> when you change
the way you think, You can change the way you feel. </strong> </li>

<li> Various quotes also support the core message, such as,

 <ul>
      <li><strong> Epictetus said in about 2000 years ago: </strong>
People are disturbed “not by things, but by the views we take of
	them.” </li>

        <li><strong>Shakespeare: </strong> “For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” </li>

	  <li><strong> Lori Deschene on Buddha’s statement: </strong>
Thoughts fuel emotions. If you don’t like what you’re feeling, step
back and examine what you’re thinking.” </li>
 </ul>
